## Review - Netlify Forms Implementation

**What was fixed:**
1. Created static HTML form detection file: `public/netlify-form-detection.html`
2. Updated `ContactForm.tsx` to use Netlify Forms instead of Functions
3. Kept Formik + Yup validation as requested
4. Build tested successfully

**Key changes:**
- `ContactForm.tsx:71-89` - Changed from Functions API to Forms submission
- Added form encoding function and proper form attributes
- Static form allows Netlify to detect the form during build time

**Next steps:**
- Deploy to Netlify to test form submissions
- Form submissions will appear in Netlify dashboard under Forms section
